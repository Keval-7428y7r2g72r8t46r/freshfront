            </h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              FreshFront may use third-party AI models and tools to help you research and produce outputs. AI can make

            </h2>

              Some features may require a paid subscription. Billing and payments are processed by third-party payment
              providers. Your subscription status may be stored in your account profile to enable access.
